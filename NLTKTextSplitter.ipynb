In both cases, a new variable is introduced with a distribution that is easy to sample from and the model learns how to decode this variable back into the original domain. We will now turn our attention to autoregressive models—a family of models that simplify the generative modeling problem by treating it as a sequential process. Autoregressive models condition predictions on previous values in the sequence, rather than on a latent random variable. Therefore, they attempt to explicitly model the data-generating distribution rather than an approximation of it (as in the case of VAEs). In this chapter we shall explore two different autoregressive models: long short-term memory networks and PixelCNN. We will apply the LSTM to text data and the PixelCNN to image data. We will cover another highly successful autoregressive model, the Transformer, in detail in Foster, David. Generative Deep Learning (pp. 224-225). O'Reilly Media. Kindle Edition.
